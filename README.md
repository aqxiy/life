9 then the GPU thing

Anything added to 9 is the same number .55 is a square across the digits

Carbon density is

Need 2 eyes for depth perception 
This makes 3d cache and electron - gravity interference different 

2 forces are electrostatic and gravity 

Something between 2d and 3d is where quantum exists 

Reality begins at shift from 2 to 3 d

2^3 == 8
3^2 == 9

2*2*2 == 8

Move 0.027777778
.083333
0.04166667

And this is .6666 + .75

So the bound sum repeats


But it's shifted over 1
While 1 is deleted

0.041666663
So in checking difference between 2 shift differences, it's the later shift difference
